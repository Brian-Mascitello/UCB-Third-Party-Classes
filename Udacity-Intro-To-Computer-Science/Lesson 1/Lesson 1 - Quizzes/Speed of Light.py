# Write Python code to print out how far light travels
# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.
# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second
# centimeters = 100            one meter is 100 centimeters
# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  one billionth of a second

# Converted to Python 3 syntax

print(299792458 * 100 * 1.0/1000000000)

# 29.9792458 cm / ns
