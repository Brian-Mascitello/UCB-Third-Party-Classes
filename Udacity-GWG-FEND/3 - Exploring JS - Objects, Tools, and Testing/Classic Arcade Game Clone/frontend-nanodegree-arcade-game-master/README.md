Classic Arcade Game Clone - Frogger!
====================================

## How to Run the Game

Download the entire game folder to your local machine. If the folder is zipped, make sure to unzip it entirely before attempting to play. After unzipping, navigate to the index.html file and double click. It should automatically open in your favorite browser, but if it does not, choose a modern web browser like Google Chrome to open the index.html file. Once opened it should look like the picture below.

## Story

Play as the hero **_Bug Boy_** and try to reach the water at the top of the screen! Use the arrow keys &larr;, &uarr;, &rarr;, and &darr; to control **_Bug Boy_**. Maneuver him around and past the enemy **_Swarminators_**, and try to reach the relaxing pool without getting hit! If you are tagged by a **_Swarminator_**, it's back to the start!

### Good luck and have fun!
