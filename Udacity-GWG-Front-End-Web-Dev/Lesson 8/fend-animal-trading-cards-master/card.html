    <p class="story">&emsp;Pangolins are scaly, carnivorous mammals that usually feed on large amounts of insects. While their favorite food is most-likely ants, they are known for eating termites and the larva of other insects. Pangolins have a great sense of smell to
      make up for their below average eyesight. They are known for their lengthy, powerful claws and their incredibly long, sticky tongues, which are both very useful when hunting for food.</p>
