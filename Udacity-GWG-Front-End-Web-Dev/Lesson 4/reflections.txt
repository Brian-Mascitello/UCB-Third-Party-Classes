Your response goes here!

1) What new skills have you learned?
Since I have taken a web development course before this has mostly been a refresher so far. I have been using PyCharm to organize my own notes and to help code the few examples so far, but I would like to find an active web editor for future work. The website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ has been really useful for looking things up as I go along.

2) What has been easy?
The whole class so far has been easy. Lots of installing, like Slack and the Udacity Feedback chrome extension were simple and Iâ€™m glad I have them. All of the code so far has been easy.

3) What has been difficult?
I have been busy applying for jobs and trying to make lifestyle improvements to lose weight. Making time for the class has been the most difficult part, but I think I am still on pace to finish ahead of schedule. I just wish I had more of a jump start to assist other students.

4) How have you used the problem-solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I frequently check the work I am doing by saving the text file and viewing it in a chrome to ensure the changes I have made are correct. I research the things I do not know, like how to make a superscript was <sup>content</sup>. Otherwise it has been pretty smooth sailing so far!
